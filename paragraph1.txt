In their early 20s, Emily and Ben set an ambitious goal: to save $100,000 in 5 years for a down payment on their dream home. They created a detailed budget, cut back on discretionary spending, and started side hustles to increase their income. They even tracked their progress on a whiteboard in their living room, marking each $1,000 saved with a star. The journey wasn't easy. There were months when they barely scraped by, and unexpected expenses threatened to derail their plans. But they stayed focused, motivated by their shared dream. After 4 years and 11 months, they reached their goal, a testament to their unwavering commitment and financial discipline.
