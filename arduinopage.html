        <h4>Calculator: Addition</h3>
        <p class="one">Arduinos are a small computer that is easy to code and a good wayto learn how computer's think and function on a smaller scale. We used them in our Computer Systems class, a begging to hardware class, to help us see how computers think  and stich our own togeather.</p>
        <p class="two">One of my favorite projects was when I made a calculator. It was ohly able to compute up to a max of four, btu ti was really cool to watch as when I clocked a light for one  and the light for two, the light for three in binary lite up.  </p>

        <h3>Joystick Game</h3>
        <p>We also had a fun time experiementing with  input and output varibales andhow they impact a computer. This project had a small coded game on the screen that we had to connect. We also connected the screen and computer to a small joystick as well, along ewith the x and y axis so it could keep track of any 2D direction.</p>
